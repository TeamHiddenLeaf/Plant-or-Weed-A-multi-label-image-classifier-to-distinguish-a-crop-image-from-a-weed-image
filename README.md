# Plant-or-Weed-A-multi-label-image-classifier-to-distinguish-a-crop-image-from-a-weed-image

# Can you differentiate a weed from a crop seedling?

The ability to do so effectively can mean better crop yields and better stewardship of the environment.

This was our final Data Mining presentation at the University of Chicago!

We are using OpenCV to crate image masks. We are tarining our models using CNN. 

The last layer of the CNN(dense layer) is fed into other models like SVM and Random Forest to check how other models behave in classifiying the images!

Current work: We are working on developing a web application using Flask! In addition, we will then deploy our application on Heroku.

Please check for regular updates as the repository can keep changing, especially the web application portion of the project.

Happy Coding!
